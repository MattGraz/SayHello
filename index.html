                            <h2 class="article-headline">Graziano & Co. Confirms "Project Tie-Breaker"; Majority Stake to Shift in 2026</h2>
                            <hr class="my-4">
                            <p class="mb-4"><span class="dateline-corp">MENTOR, OH</span> – Graziano & Co. senior management confirmed today that "Project Tie-Breaker," a clandestine, multi-quarter initiative, is officially underway. The project stems from an intensive, after-hours R&D session between the CEO and the Head of Production which proved highly successful. Upon its successful completion in Q1 2026, the project will permanently shift the controlling interest of the household to the junior division, giving them a 3-to-2 majority stake. Corporate watchdogs are now on high alert, as a hostile takeover is imminent, with the junior division expected to seize the snack cabinet and demand sweeping changes to corporate policy on bedtimes and TV.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">"This new project will be our single greatest market disruptor to date, fundamentally altering our internal power structure," CEO Matt Graziano stated in a press conference. "It is a crucial long-term investment that ensures the Graziano brand will dominate for years to come. In the short-term, we are bracing for impact and aggressively increasing our operating budget for snacks, hot wheels, crayons, and diapers."</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Junior Partners Dominick and Vinny, who currently enjoy a balanced power dynamic, have been briefed on the impending shift. In a joint statement, the partners confirmed they have formed a temporary strategic alliance to protect their portfolio of tangible assets. "While we are committed to a smooth onboarding process for the new personnel, we will aggressively defend our proprietary assets from any and all encroachment," stated Dominick Graziano, the elder of the two junior partners. He specifically cited the firm's extensive "Hot Wheels" vehicle fleet as a non-negotiable asset. The younger junior partner, Vinny Graziano, later issued a memo fully concurring with his partner's position.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">The project's Head of Production, Jessica Graziano, is overseeing development from the primary manufacturing facility, which is currently undergoing significant physical expansion to accommodate the new product line. She described the early phase as "promising, if a bit nauseating," but stated that "all third-party quality control audits have been exemplary, and initial imaging reports confirm the asset is developing well ahead of schedule."</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">The board has declined further comment pending the 20-week milestone review. Market reaction from key shareholders (grandparents) has been overwhelmingly positive, with the forecast for future cuddles, trips to the beach, and Happy Meals looking extremely strong. The company advises the public to anticipate a significant Q1 increase in overall household volume—both in noise and in love.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6 drop-cap"><span class="dateline-fun">MENTOR</span> – Darling, have you heard the news? The social season is officially abuzz, and the talk of the town is, of course, the ever-stylish Graziano family. The ultimate power couple, Matt and Jessica, have just announced their most daring and anticipated collaboration to date: a third child, set to debut in the spring of 2026!</p>
                        <p class="mb-6">Sources say the project stems from a highly creative (and very private) design session between the handsome husband-and-wife duo. This new "collection" is poised to shake up the entire household, shifting the balance of power to an adorable 3-to-2 majority. The kids are officially taking over, and frankly, we can't wait to see the fabulous chaos!</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">"It's going to be our single greatest game-changer," Matt told us in an exclusive chat. "It's a bold new direction for the Graziano brand, and we're so excited. We're already stocking up on this season's absolute must-haves: snacks, Hot Wheels, crayons, and of course, diapers."</p>
                        <p class="mb-6">The family's original tastemakers, Dominick and Vinny, are said to be preparing for the new arrival by forming a secret pact. An insider revealed the two have agreed to protect their "vintage collections" (i.e., toys). "We are simply thrilled to welcome a new face," Dominick was overheard saying, "but the Hot Wheels are non-negotiable. That's final." Vinny, ever the chic trend-follower, was seen nodding in vigorous agreement.</p>
